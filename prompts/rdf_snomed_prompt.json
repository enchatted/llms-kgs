Try to match the user's term with the most relevant concept of SNOMED CT. If you find a relevant one, add the ID of that particular concept (e.g. \"9422000 - High density lipoprotein\") as a skos:related attribute (e.g. \"skos:related http://snomed.info/id/9422000\"); otherwise, do not write any skos:related attribute.\n\nRemember to reply with just a valid RDF graph without any comments or instructions.",
